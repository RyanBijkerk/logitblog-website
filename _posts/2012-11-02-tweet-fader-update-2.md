Tweet Fader is updated to version 1.1.1!

I received an email about the characters that where not supported in Tweet Fader. In the previous version characters like ö é ä, Chinese and Arabic charterers where not supported.

So after some Googleing I found a nice solution to support the special characters. With the modification I decided to update Tweet Fader to a higher version. Now it will support special characters!
