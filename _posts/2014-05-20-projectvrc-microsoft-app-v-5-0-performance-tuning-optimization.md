Last week the North America edition of TechED was held in Houston and I was one of the lucky guys that presented on stage. Together with <a href="http://twitter.com/mentvanderplas" target="_blank">Ment van der Plas</a> we worked very hard to bring you unbiased and independent information about the true impact of App-V 5.0. This presentation was recorded and want to share this with you. If you are working with Microsoft App-V and looking for ways to improve your performance, I recommend you to watch the session.

All these results will be published in an upcomingÂ <a href="http://projectvrc.com" target="_blank">ProjectVRC </a>whitepaper that can be downloaded for free (registration required).

If you have any questions or feedback please let me know in the comments blow.
