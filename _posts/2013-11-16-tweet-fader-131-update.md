Today a Tweet Fader update is released with two fixes. There been some reports with the following message:
<blockquote>failed to open stream: No such file or directory</blockquote>
With the minor update the problem should be solved thanks to <strong>anmolrajdev</strong> on the support forum. Also solved in this update is the unknown characters in the retweets.
