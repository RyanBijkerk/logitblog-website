Last week Citrix had their yearly event Citrix Synergy hosted in sunny Atlanta, Georgia in the United States. These tech conferences are very valuable to get educated about the latest products, best practices and experiences from the field, and to network with fellow peers. This blog post will focus on some interesting presentations from this year event.

## Keynote of Citrix Synergy
Lets first start with the opening keynote from Citrix Synergy. There are a lot of great writeups from the keynote but these are my personal highlight. For a complete overview, I recommend to watch the 2-hour keynote or check the blog post from Jack at [BrianMadden.com](https://www.brianmadden.com/opinion/Citrix-Synergy-2019-live-blog){:target="_blank"}.

It is clear within the opening keynote Citrix is really focusing on modern ways of working, or how Citrix is calling it, Citrix Workspace intelligent experience. The intelligent workspace is providing work in a feed format, like Facebook or Twitter, where employees can quickly clear tasks by using “micro applications”. These “micro applications” are tasks and workflows integrated into other systems. This way tasks like approving expenses or submitting time off can be done in a couple simple clicks without leaving the Workspace.

Another highlight is the integration with Microsoft Windows Virtual Desktops on Azure. Citrix Cloud customers can combine Citrix Cloud with Windows Virtual Desktop on Azure. Once the Windows Virtual Desktop is fully available Citrix will offer day-1 support.

The keynote did contain a risky statement regarding performance compared to VMware Horizon BlastExtreme. According to Citrix, they have seen up to 89% difference in cost to run VMware Horizon BlastExterme compared to Citrix HDX on the same platform. During the keynote, no source was shared so personally, I’m very curious how this is measured. This would be perfect research for the research platform, [GO-EUC](https://www.go-euc.com){:target="_blank"}.

During the keynote, Google Cloud was on the stage where Citrix emphasize the partnership with Google. Citrix is integrating with the most common public cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud. However, I did notice Citrix states Google is the best in the cloud. Within the EUC workspace, especially in Europe, Google is not really adopted as the cloud provider for these kinds of workloads. I’m personally interested in how this evolves within Europe.

## Other interesting sessions from Citrix Synergy
