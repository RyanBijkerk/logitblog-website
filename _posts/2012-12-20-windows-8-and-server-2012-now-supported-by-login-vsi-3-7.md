Login VSI B.V. announces Login VSI 3.7; the newest version of the industry standard performance and scalability testing tool for Virtual Desktop Infrastructures and Server Based Computing environments. The initial announcement was made a few days ago in Tokyo on a press-event held in honor of the Login VSI partner of the year 2012, Networld Corporation in Japan.

<strong>Support for latest relevant technologies</strong>
The main focus of Login VSI 3.7 is to support the latest relevant technologies in the desktop virtualization market. Login VSI 3.7 introduces out-of-the-box support for simulating user workloads to test the performance of VDI and SBC environments based on Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 and Microsoft Office 2013. With this new version Login VSI also introduces support for Oracle Virtual Desktop Infrastructure.

<strong>Extended multi-language support</strong>
Login VSI 3.7 also extends the multi-language capabilities of Login VSI. Login VSI 3.7 introduces new pre-configured language profiles for English, Japanese, German and Dutch. Login VSI Express 3.7, the free entry-level version of Login VSI, now supports non-English Windows OS and Microsoft Office versions (a feature previously only available in Login VSI Pro).

<strong>Improved custom (core) workload analysis</strong>
The core workload in Login VSI provides a pre-defined but open structure to create customized user workloads. In Login VSI 3.7 the core workload is extended with timers, allowing custom workloads to be analyzed in more detail than before.

<i>“We see an increasing need in the market to test the performance of VDI and SBC environments. More and more companies are starting to realize that a good desktop performance is crucial for satisfied and productive employees”</i> said Eric-Jan van Leeuwen, CEO of Login VSI B.V. <i>“This new version of Login VSI will enable all organizations that are committed to an optimal virtual desktop performance, to test the impact of upgrading to the latest versions of all relevant Windows products”.</i>
