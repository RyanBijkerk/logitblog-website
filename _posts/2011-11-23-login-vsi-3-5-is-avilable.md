<p style="text-align: justify;">Login Consultants released Login VSI 3.5. The update offers new analysis and comparison possibilities and simplifies usage and deployment even further.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jeroen van de Kamp, CTO Login Consultants said:</p>
“<em>Login VSI is developed specifically for (vendor) independent benchmarking of virtualized desktop infrastructures and is becoming the worldwide industry standard for testing SBC and VDI environments</em>. <em>Almost every large vendor uses Login VSI for research and development in their laboratory. This encouraged us to enhance Login VSI with more options to gain detailed test results</em>”.
