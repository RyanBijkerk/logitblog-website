The new Tweet Fader update is released! This release contains two new features. I received a couple of suggestions to include a timestamp in the Tweet Fader <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2238" src="http://www.logitblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/screenshot-2.png" alt="screenshot-2" width="177" height="119" />plugin. In this release the timestamp is included in Tweet Fader.

You can decide to add the timestamp or not by simply checking the checkbox in the widget setting. The timestamp is based on <a href="http://mattbradley.github.com/livestampjs/" target="_blank">Livestamp <img class="size-full wp-image-2236 alignright" src="http://www.logitblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="260" height="287" /></a>and will update live.

In the previous version of Tweet Fader the web links were opening in the same browser window. Now you can decide if the links need to open in a new window or tab. This is done by checking the checkbox in the settings window.
