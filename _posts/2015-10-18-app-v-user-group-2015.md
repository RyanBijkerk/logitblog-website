It has been a while since the last App-V User Group 2015 and recently Login Consultants has published the recordings of the sessions. The App-V User Group is a conference where you can learn from the knowledge and experiences of the App-V experts, also known as Microsoft’s Most Valued Persons (MVP’s), from all over the world. Over 100 people from 14 different countries attended the event which is exactly what we want to achieve: bringing international App-V users from end user companies together and share the do’s and don'ts. This blog post contains all the session recordings of the App-V User Group 2015.

<h2>Tim Mangan | 4, 3, 2, 1, Liftoff! Launch of an App-V environment (How Processes Become Virtualized)</h2>
Microsoft App-V 5.0 has four different ways that processes become detected and virtualized. This is quite different than 4.x which used a launcher program start virtual environments.  In this session, Tim Mangan will dive deep into the mechanisms in play to start virtual environments.  We’ll cover the new 5.0 SP3 options for Connection Groups (including recommended practices), RunVirtual, and Dynamic Virtualization (JitV).  Fair warning: bring your own aspirin.

<h2>Falko Graefe | App-V and UEM - Do you need a Profile Management Solution for App-V?</h2>
An User Environment Solution was a nice-to-have addition to an  App-V 4 deployment; that version handled user settings quite good for its own. But how does that look like in App-V 5 with its totally different architecture. And what about integration points - all new, all good? And even better with recent updates? You will see!

<h2>Ralph Jansen &amp; Bram Wolfs | The pros and cons of the most commonly used deployment products</h2>
App-V 5 is currently worldwide the most popular application virtualization product in the market. It has a market share of 25,1 %. Because the market adopts App-V as the standard for application virtualization, the App-V server isn't the only solution to deliver the applications to the workspace. 3th party tools are built to offer the same, and even more, features to deploy, modify and monitor applications.

The question that enterprise customer are struggling with is what product to use for deployment of their virtual applications when multiple products are available. The product that seems legitimate at the first look may cause limitations in the future.

In this session the pros and cons of the most commonly used deployment products are explained so you can better decide what product to choose.

<h2>Nicke Källén | App-V and Adobe | Packaging in practice</h2>
Adobe is the vendor that has given IT admins a headache since day one. Over the time their offering towards the IT admins have improved, but yet there isn’t a complete unified way for the entire company on how to deliver their software.

As a way to explore App-V 5 packaging capabilities we will explore the Adobe suite of software and how to leverage App-V as a way to improve the delivery of Adobe software.

This will include:
<ul>
 	<li>Licensing</li>
 	<li>What does Adobe offer?</li>
 	<li>How-to package</li>
 	<li>Integration</li>
 	<li>Performance</li>
 	<li>Virtual Extension</li>
 	<li>Patching</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ryan Bijkerk | Measuring your App-V application availability with Login PI</h2>
Login PI gives performance insights by simulating real users and real user tasks. The virtual user logs in and launches common applications, recording how long it takes for the tasks to complete. The system then watches for any large discrepancies in the results and can generate alerts based on those discrepancies. For example, if logging on normally takes seconds, but one day takes minutes, Login PI will notify an administrator that something is not working as expected in the environment. This session will show how to use Login PI within an App-V environment to get you these performance insights of your App-V applications.
