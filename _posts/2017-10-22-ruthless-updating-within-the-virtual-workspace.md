Nowadays, software companies are continuously pushing new releases (for example Microsoft with Windows 10). These releases result in a constant change process within the organization. In theory, these updates contain new functionalities and improvement but in practice, it may affect the virtual workspace negatively.

<h2>The effect of an update within the virtual workspace</h2>
It's getting more common for software companies to release in a frequent increment. One example is Microsoft with Windows 10. Instead of the 1 to 2 update releases in the total lifetime of the operating system, Microsoft switched to 2 updates releases each year. Each release contains new functionalities and improvements.

Within the virtual workspace, the release not only affects Windows 10 but also the other components in the entire infrastructure (like Citrix or VMware), and this is a bottleneck. It is not clear what the impact is on all the other components within the virtual workspace after the update. It may affect the performance, capacity or the user experience.

What if the entire virtual workspace does not work and the end users cannot do their work with all the financial consequences?

Getting these insights of the impact of the changes on the components within the infrastructure is crucial. Only this way you can get in control of the updates.

<h2>Measurement brings knowledge</h2>
Within the market, there are multiple products that can help with IT departments to get the insights within the virtual workspace. The most obvious is a monitoring solution. Monitoring solutions can provide insights into the activities in the workspace. But the traditional monitoring solutions are reactive and often too late with the effect of a change.

Besides monitoring solutions there are also products that simulate users. These solutions simulate users on the infrastructure and generating load. This way it's possible to proactively validate the pending change by simulating users in a controlled environment.
<blockquote>The solutions within your organization are depending on your situation. ICT-Partners offers a service called the Performance Services. The Performance Services identifies your needs and offers a custom-made program (based on our toolset and experience) to realize the insight within your virtual desktop infrastructure.</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
With the insight of the pending changes, it's possible to apply the correct update strategy. This way any negative impact is clear in advantage and other alternative solutions can be prepared (for example upscaling the capacity of the infrastructure or disabled new added functionalities). This way you can guarantee the best user experience and avoid problems and money loss.
