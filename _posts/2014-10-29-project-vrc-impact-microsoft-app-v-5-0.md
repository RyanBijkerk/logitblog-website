A new white paper has been released by Project VRC which is all about the Impact of Microsoft App-V 5.0. This white paper contains detailed performance data which can be applied to diverse App-V infrastructures. If you are using Microsoft App-V 5.0, this white paper is a must read. In this blog post I want to explain why you should read this white paper.
<blockquote><strong>Please note:</strong> this is a personal blog and not an official Project VRC or Login VSI blog post.</blockquote>
When designing an App-V infrastructure you have many options how to implement the solution. Understanding the impact is very important to be able to deliver the best end-user experience. Use this white paper as a guide to understand the performance benefits of specific options and implementations.

This white paper also contains detailed information of the sequencing the applications. There are best practices which are often applied within an organization. But does these best practice influencing the performance? Within this white paper these best practices are tested on the performance with existing results. So if you are a sequencer this white paper has many benefits for you.
